Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to find and save books of their interest. It uses GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to communicate with the server and the client. It also uses the Google Books API, a service that provides information about millions of books, to search for books by keywords. Users can create an account, log in, and view their saved books. They can also add or remove books from their list by clicking on the save or delete buttons. Book Search Engine is built with the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It is a SPA (Single Page Application), which means that it renders dynamic content without reloading the page. Book Search Engine is a fast, responsive, and user-friendly application that can help users discover new books and keep track of their favorites.
