Welcome to ‘My Tech Now’, a CMS-style blog site that serves as a platform for sharing insights, experiences, and knowledge about the latest technologies. This full-stack application is a testament to the power of modern web development tools and practices. The application is built using MySQL, Express, Handlebars, and a RESTful API.

Handlebars, a popular templating engine, is used for creating the user interface. It allows for dynamic rendering of HTML, making the site more interactive and responsive. The application also utilizes a RESTful API, which provides a set of conventions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. This makes the application more scalable and maintainable.

The application is hosted on GitHub, a platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. You can check out the source code and more details about the project in the repository.
