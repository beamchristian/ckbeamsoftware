Shop-Shop is a modern and user-friendly e-commerce site that lets you browse and buy a variety of products online. You can create an account, add items to your cart, and securely checkout with Stripe. Shop-Shop is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), and uses Apollo GraphQL and Redux for state management. It also supports offline functionality with IndexedDB, so you can shop anytime, anywhere.
